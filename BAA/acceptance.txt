We have been tasked to create a web server where users can track how many games players have won

1) GET /players/{name} should return a number indicating total number of wins
2) POST /players/{name} should record a win for that name, incrementing for every subsequent POST

Chicken and egg problem

How can we incrementally build this?  We can't GET a player without having stored something and it
seems hard to know if POST has worked without the GET endpoint already existing.

Let the MOCKS begin!

GET will need a PlayerStore thing to get scores for a player. This should be an interface so when
we test we can create a simple stub to test our code without needing to have implemented any actual
storage code.

For POST we can spy on its calls to PlayerStore to make sure it stores players correctly.
Our implementation of saving won't be coupled to retrieval.

For having some working software quickly we can make a very simple in-memory implementation and then
later we can create an implementation backed by whatever storage mechanism we prefer.
